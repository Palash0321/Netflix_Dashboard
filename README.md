# Netflix Dashboard

## 1. Project Overview

This project presents an interactive dashboard that visualizes key insights from the cleaned Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset. The dashboard is designed to provide a quick and easy way to understand different aspects of Netflix's content library.

## 2. Tools Used

* **Data Visualization Tool (e.g., Tableau):** Used to create the interactive dashboard.
  
## 3. Dashboard Explanation 

This dashboard combines several interactive sections and charts to give a clear overview of the Netflix content data.

### Overall Dashboard Title:

* **Title:** "Netflix Analysis"
* **What it means:** This is the main title of the entire report, indicating that the dashboard is dedicated to analyzing Netflix's movie and TV show content.

### Filter Controls (On the Left Side):

These controls allow you to interact with the dashboard and focus on specific data:

* **Type Filter:** Allows you to choose between viewing only "Movie" data, only "TV Show" data, or both.
* **Release Year Filter:** Helps you narrow down content based on the year it was originally released.

### Charts (The Main Visual Reports):

Here are the specific charts on the dashboard and what they show:

1.  **Top-Left Chart: "Total Movies and TV Shows by Country"**
    * **What it is:** This visualization displays the total count of movies and TV shows for different countries. (You previously mentioned this might be a map chart, which is a common way to show data by country, or it could be another visualization like a bar chart).
    * **What it tells you:** It shows you how much content Netflix has associated with each country.

2.  **Top-Right Chart: "Movies & TV Shows distribution"**
    * **What it is:** This is a **Bubble Chart**. It visually represents the distribution or proportion of movies versus TV shows in your dataset using circles (bubbles) of different sizes.
    * **What it tells you:** It gives you an immediate sense of the balance between movies and TV shows in Netflix's content library.

3.  **Middle-Left Chart: "Content by Rating"**
    * **What it is:** This is a **Bar Chart**. It lists different content ratings (like TV-MA, PG-13, etc.) and uses horizontal bars to show the count of titles for each rating.
    * **What it tells you:** It highlights the distribution of content across various age/content ratings on Netflix.

4.  **Bottom-Left Chart: "Top 10 Genres"**
    * **What it is:** This is a **Bar Chart**. It displays the top 10 genres based on the number of titles, using horizontal bars.
    * **What it tells you:** It quickly identifies the most popular or most abundant content categories on Netflix.

5.  **Bottom-Right Chart: "Total Movies and TV Shows by Year"**
    * **What it is:** This is an **Area Chart**. It shows the trend of total movies and TV shows over time, likely with "Year" on the horizontal axis and "Count" on the vertical axis, filled with a colored area.
    * **What it tells you:** It provides a clear view of how Netflix's content library (both movies and TV shows combined) has grown year by year.

### Conclusion:

This dashboard serves as a powerful visual tool to explore the Netflix content. By interacting with the filters and reviewing these charts, users can gain quick insights into content distribution by country, the balance of movies versus TV shows, top contributors like directors and popular genres, and how the overall content library has expanded over time.
